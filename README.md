# Candy Store Take Home Exercise

Welcome! This take home exercise is designed to simulate the onboarding experience of a Senior Quality Assurance Analyst joining an in progress project. You'll be evaluating a live, in development web application that has not yet received professional QA attention.

---

## Scenario

You have just been brought in to support the quality efforts of an active development project. The application was developed by engineers with only developer-level testing. It is now live and continues to evolve as new features and fixes are deployed.

You are the first QA professional on the team, and your responsibility is to define how quality assurance will be handled from this point forward — both initially and on an ongoing basis.

The application under test is:

👉 **https://sweetshop.netlify.app/**

## Your Mission

1. **Define a QA Approach**

   - Treat this as the foundation of your long-term QA strategy for this project.
   - Consider both **initial testing** and a **sustainable testing approach** that supports continued development.
   - Your approach should include:
     - A general testing strategy (e.g. risk-based, exploratory, regression-first, etc.)
     - Tooling (manual and/or automated)
     - Test types and focus areas (e.g. functional, usability, responsive, accessibility, performance, etc.)
     - Communication/documentation methods
     - Proposed workflows or checkpoints with developers/product team

2. **Execute an Initial Evaluation**
   - Spend a limited amount of time (1–2 hours) conducting a **smoke test** of the site.
   - Provide sample findings just as you would when joining a real project. These might include:
     - Bug reports
     - Usability or accessibility issues
     - Suggestions for improvement
     - Screenshots or recordings, where helpful

---

## Deliverables

- A test plan or strategy document (Markdown, PDF, or linked Google Doc is fine)
- At least one sample test case document or test suite outline
- An outline or proof-of-concept of automated test coverage (e.g. a GitHub repo with sample test scripts, or a documented plan with sample code or pseudocode)
- Any other documentation you would produce at the start of a project (e.g., bug templates, test data plans, reporting approach, etc.)
- A short summary of your experience during the smoke test (things that stood out, areas of concern, etc.)

## Submission

Send all deliverables in a ZIP file or shared folder (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox) to **Josh Gretz**.

---

## Notes

- You do **not** need to fully automate tests, but please demonstrate how you would approach automation as part of your strategy.
- You are welcome to use any tools or frameworks you prefer (e.g. Playwright, Cypress, Postman, TestRail, etc.)
- Focus on clarity and practicality (pretend you're handing this off to your future self or onboarding a new QA hire)
